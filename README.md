# Project_Python

This code provides a simple command-line phonebook application that allows users to manage contacts by adding, searching, deleting, and listing them.

Functions:

add_contact(): Adds a new contact to the phonebook if the contact doesn't already exist.
search_contact(): Searches for a contact by name and displays the phone number if found.
delete_contact(): Deletes a contact from the phonebook if the name exists.
list_contacts(): Displays all the contacts and their phone numbers in the phonebook.
The main() function provides a menu-driven interface for the user to interact with the phonebook.
